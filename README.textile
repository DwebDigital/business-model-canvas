h1. Business Model Canvas App "!https://codeclimate.com/github/dgilperez/business-model-canvas.png!":https://codeclimate.com/github/dgilperez/business-model-canvas

Small little app to create, store and share business model canvas amongst your BizDev pals.

This is a quick personal experiment. Use it at your own risk.

h2. Dependencies

Before running this app, you will need:

* The Ruby language (version 1.9.3)
* Rails 3.2
* A working installation of "MongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org/ (version 1.6.0 or newer)

See "Installing Rails 3.2":http://railsapps.github.com/installing-rails.html for detailed instructions and advice.

h4. Installing MongoDB

If you don't have MongoDB installed on your computer, you'll need to install it and set it up to be always running on your computer (run at launch). On Mac OS X, the easiest way to install MongoDB is to install "Homebrew":http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ and then run the following:

<pre>
brew install mongodb
</pre>
